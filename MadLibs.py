The other day, I was really in trouble. It all started when I saw a very {adjective} {animal}
{verb} down the hallway. "{exclamation.capitalize()}!" I yelled. But all I could think to do was to {verb2}
over and over. Miraculously, that caused it to stop, but not before it tried to {verb3} right
in front of my family. 

Then suddenly a {color} {animal2} jumped out of the {place} while 
eating a giant {food}!
